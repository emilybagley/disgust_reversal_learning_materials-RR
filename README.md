<h3><b>Materials made available with the stage 1 Registered Report</b></h3>
<p>This repository contains the code for the video rating, reversal learning and digit span tasks.</p>
<p>Additionally, we include details of how the videos used in the video rating and reversal learning tasks are selected.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>List of files</b></p>
<p>digit_span_task.html: creates a digit-span working memory test - adapted from this repository: https://github.com/mahiluthra/working_memory_tests/tree/master </p>
<p>index.html: contains code for the video rating task, personalised stimulus selection and the reversal learning task</p>
<p>stimulus_selection.ipynb: outlines how the 5 fear- and 5 disgust-inducing videos were chosen from the Cowen and Keltner (2017) database</p>
<br>
<br>
<p><b>Stimuli/fractals</b></p>
<p> The 5 fear and 5 disgust inducing videos used in the video ratings and reversal learning task are not shared here as they were ascertained from the Cowen and Keltner database - which is accessible via this online form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScf9XVemSUWz6kUWySUdaQ5pxwqs8mugngrkBoLmX-3DMX1KA/viewform .</p>
<p>The videos we are using are (as named in the Cowen and Keltner database): </p>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  0046.mp4, 0374.mp4, 0548.mp4, 0877.mp4, 1202.mp4 (5 fear-inducing videos) </p>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  0888.mp4, 1414.mp4, 1765.mp4, 1987.mp4, 2106.mp4 (5-disgust inducing videos) </p>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1686.mp4 (neutral/'safe' video used in all three blocks of the reversal learning task)</p>
  <br>
  <p>Similarly, the 'fractals' used in the reversal learning task are not shared here, but are publically available via this link: https://github.com/smathot/materials_for_P0010.5/tree/master/stimuli/exp2/images .</p>
  <p>The fractals used are (as named in the linked github repository):</p>
  <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; F000.png, F009.png, F010.png, F012.png,  F014.png, F015.png, F018.png, F020.png</p>
<br>
<p> All other stimuli necessary for the task are found in this repository - in the reversal_learning_stim folder(e.g., audios for the videos, yellow and blue background colours).</p>
